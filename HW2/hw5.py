# Homework #5

# In all the exercises that follow, insert your code directly in this file
# and immediately after each question.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES: 
#
# 1) THIS IS A PROGRAMMING COURSE. :-) THIS MEANS THAT THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS
# ARE MEANT TO BE DONE IN CODE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. E.G., WHEN A QUESTION SAYS "COUNT
# THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT [...]" YOU SHOULD INTERPRET THIS AS "WRITE CODE THAT COUNTS
# THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT [...]". USE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT AND YOU WILL DO FINE. :-)
#
# 2) WHEN A QUESTION PROVIDES A VALUE FOR YOU TO USE IN COMPUTATIONS, FIRST STORE IT IN
# A VARIABLE AND WRITE CODE THAT MAKES USE OF THAT VARIABLE.

Question 1
  
1.1) Create a list called 'friends' containing the first names of 5
friends of yours, ranked in ascending chronological order based on
when you met them. (The oldest friend goes first; the most recent one
goes last.) Print that list.

1.2) Suppose you realize that you have recently made a new friend,
most likely another hardcore Python geek taking our course. Use a
function to add their name to the end of the list and print the
updated list.

1.3) Print the name of the second oldest friend on your list, using
the % operator or .template(). Supposing Maria is your second oldest
friend on the list, then your code should print:
  
     Maria is the second oldest friend on my friends list.

1.4) Using a *single statement* (ie, just one line of code), replace
the third and fourth friends on your list with two new names of your
choice. The rest of your list should remain unchanged. Print the list
'friends' again.

1.5) Unfortunately, it turned out that Python geeks cannot be trusted
and you are no longer friends with the person you added in Question
1.2. Remove them from the list 'friends' and print the list again.

1.6) Print the names of the friends on your list ordered
alphabetically, while leaving the original list 'friends' unchanged.
(To avoid complications due to capitalization, you can simply ensure
all names are capitalized in the same way when you insert them.
*Optional*: if you want practice with a common real-world task, write
your code so that it can correctly sort the names regardless of how
the user enters them.)

Question 2

Below you will find a list of product prices in USD below (prices_usd).

2.1) Create a new empty list called prices_brl.

2.2) Use a for loop to populate the newly created list prices_brl
with the same prices, but converted into Brazilian real. (As of Feb
28th, the exchange rate is approximately 1 USD = 3.74 BRL.) 

2.3) Modify the original list prices_usd so that it contains the
*rounded* prices. (The prices can be stored either as int or float,
but must not have decimal values.)

2.4) Modify the list prices_usd so that the prices are sorted from the
highest to the lowest.

"""

prices_usd = [48.8, 28.9, 58.4, 51.0, 98.0, 75.7, 14.8]
