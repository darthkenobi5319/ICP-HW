    "Unfortunately, Python is a bit inconsistent in how it function arguments are treated. Arguments that are strings and numbers cannot be modified by the functions that receive those arguments. However, collections and other more complicated that types (including dictionaries, as in our code above) *can* be modified by the function that receives them as arguments. This is rather inconsistent and confusing, so I recommend always using the approach we used above. (But please be aware that, when the arguments passed to a function are (e.g.) a list or a dictionary, any changes made inside a function to those arguments will effectively outlast the execution of the function.)"

Try to have your code extract some additional news articles by having it automatically visit those other pages and also extracting news articles from them."
